# Scripts Directory

Place custom build scripts, utilities (such as database migrations), and automation tools here.

These scripts can use the @/ alias to import from src/:

```typescript
import { formatCount } from '@/libs/utils/format';
```

Run scripts with:

```bash
bun run scripts/your-script.ts
```

Or add a shortcut to package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "script:name": "bun run scripts/your-script.ts"
}
```
